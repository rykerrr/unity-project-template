Collection of code that seems reusable across most projects I've done with a focus on SOLID

Singleton ManagerManager object that works with the Marker pattern (IManagerObject) to get all manager objects during runtime
Object removal with the IRemovalProcessor interface, collision processing with the ICollisionProcessor interface
Object pooling system, and some other stuff I tend to reuse a lot
